POLARITY <- "positive" #{"positive", "negative"} #needed this format for annotation to work
# file_conversion and pre-processing need to be performed seperate
# only choose "both" when no pre-processing needed (eg. merge both ionisationmodes)
USER_COMMENT <- "Tutorial comment" #Add info about experiment, eg. explain (Multiple)Comparisons, to include in reports
