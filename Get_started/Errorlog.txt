##########Frequently got errors##########
#### MAIN ####
Error in setwd(path_R_scripts) : cannot change working directory
= forget to change path of computer, or typing error in folder "R_scripts" (eg. Rscripts)

Error in setwd(path_data_in) : cannot change working directory
= path is correct, problem: projectname wrong (eg written with space), non-existent folder to input (development after source config w wrong name)

Error : cannot allocate vector of size 7.8 Mb
or 
killed during process 
= not enough RAM for R pipeline to compute (probably step annotate from part pre-processing Thermo), increase RAM of Rbox if possible

Not engough space
= hard drive is full, free up space for calculating

Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : cannot open the connection
= close excel, close other files opened, check path in main.r correct 

Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection
Calls: source -> file
In addition: Warning message: In file (filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open file 'configuration.R': No such file or directory
Execution halted
= configuration.r.r extension is wrong, check configuration.r instead of twice suffix .r

(process:5453): Pango-WARNING **: Invalid UTF-8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()
= created/exported txt can be in wrong format (incorrect UTF-8), copy/paste from txt to txt to solve.



#### PART 1: pre-processing####
Thermo:
Error in xcmsSet(files = filenames, ppm = ppm, mzdiff = mzwid, noise = noise,  : 
  No NetCDF/mzXML/mzData/mzML files were found.
= zipped folder was above both bio/blank, need 2 zips for each bank/bio. of unzipped also ok, both also ok
= or you want to run REIMS files, so selected wrong instrument 

Error in eval(ei, envir) : object 'RUN_PART_MERGEVM' not found
= na run part 1 alles gedaan, maar geen probleem. alles loopt

Error in .local(object, ...) : 
  21 of the specified 'rtrange' are completely outside of the retention time range of 'object' which is (1.06432, 839.072998046875). The first was: (849.2555, 1069.2555!
Calls: source ... diffreport -> diffreport -> .local -> getEIC -> getEIC -> .local
=> some samples in bio/blankfolder were run for other time (eg. spoelmethode shorter time)? remove those, so only 1 aquisition time and rt alignment possible

Error in '[<- '('*tmp*', iterRow, sample, value = iterPeak) :
  subscript of of bounds
Calls: source ... do_groupChromPeaks_nearest -> sapply -> lapply -> FUN
= min. 1 wrong/dissimilar blank sample (eg spoel), use only 1 blank instead or remove the wrong blank and rerun
= OR/AND 1 corrupt file (empty spectra) still present, need to find and remove this sample from input folder

Applying retention time correction to 210105_se129.mzXML
Error in profEIC(objectn mzrange = mzrane, rtrange = rtrange, step = step) :
  'mzrange' number 3177 (799.xxxx, 799.xxxx) is outside of mz value range of 'object'
Calls: source ... getEIC -> .local -> getEIC -> getEIC -> .local -> profEIC
= rm this file (in eg. above, 210105_se129.mzXML) and rerun

Error in .local(object, ...) : 
  Dimensions of profile matrices do not match !
= occurs at retcor() step because a raw file is containing less scans (can be checked in mzXML file > scanCount), discard the previous-to-last file above this error message to solve.
